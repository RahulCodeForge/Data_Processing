# Data_Processing
This Python function processes employee data to calculate salary information by department. Given a dictionary of employee records containing each employeeâ€™s name, department, and monthly salary, the function computes

##The total salary expense for each department
##The average salary per department

Additionally, it gracefully handles cases where departments may have no employees, ensuring all departments are represented in the output. This solution emphasizes clean code, readability, and avoids using external libraries for algorithmic processing.
